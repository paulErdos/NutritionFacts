Frontend:
* Vanilla React may be most strategic.
* NextUI looks cool, but component libraries probably aren't the ideal.
* Things built on top of Tailwind might be right. Because what I'm looking for
  isn't components, but styling. I can write the components, and probably should
  keep that up. When I'm sharp at it I'm good. 

Backend:
Falcon: runs fast, and I write it fast
Actix: runs ~10x as fast, low electricity demand, idk rust yet, and knowing it is an active goal, as is diversifying my languageset.
